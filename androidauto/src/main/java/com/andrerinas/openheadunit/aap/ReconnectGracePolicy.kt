/**
 * How long the projection activity holds its reconnecting overlay before giving up and finishing.
 *
 * A wired reconnect used to get a flat 8 s, which is shorter than the app's own worst case for the
 * recovery it has to cover: 3 s before the service even rescans, then an AOA switch
 * `UsbAccessoryHandoffPolicy` sizes at 10 s. So a phone that re-enumerated in normal mode was given
 * up on while its switch was still running, and the session came back to a home screen.
 *
 * The answer is evidence rather than a bigger number. A bus that stays empty still ends at the base,
 * because nothing is coming back; a reconnect that is visibly in flight buys [PROGRESS_GRACE_MS]
 * from each sign of life, bounded by [CEILING_MS] so it cannot hold the overlay forever.
