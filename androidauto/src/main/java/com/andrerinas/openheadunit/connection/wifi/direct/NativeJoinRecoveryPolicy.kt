 * What the Native AA join watchdog should do when no phone has joined the group.

 * Recreating repairs a phone that took credentials and could not join. A phone that has not opened
 * the Android Auto Bluetooth channel since this arming was never handed any, so the group is not
 * what is wrong and the interface cycle is spent for nothing. Scoped to the arming rather than the
 * process, or a reconnect attempt inherits the last session's dial and recreates for a phone that
 * has asked for nothing.
