/**
 * When to tell the user that the link cannot carry the video stream they have asked for.
 *
 * The failure this exists to name, measured 2026-08-05 on a head unit hotspot: over a 2.4 GHz
 * access point at 1080p/60 the phone completed the Bluetooth handshake, joined the network, opened
 * the AAP session and the video channel — and then closed the socket 0.04–4.2 s later, having sent
 * **not one video frame**. Thirty-two times in under five minutes, each cycle looking like a fresh,
 * healthy connection right up to the moment it ended. On the same access point, same band, same
 * everything, an 800x480/30 stream held for as long as it was watched; and at 1080p/60 on 5 GHz it
 * held too. So this is a throughput ceiling, not a broken route — and the phone's own reason
 * (`GAL_SOCKET_CONNECTION_FAILED`) never reaches our log.
 *
 * We cannot read the band an access point is running on: `SoftApInfo`'s frequency needs
 * NETWORK_SETTINGS, which no ordinary app holds. What we can see is the shape — a session that
 * reached SSL and then died having rendered nothing, over and over. That is specific enough to act
 * on, and nothing else produces it: a phone that never joins never gets this far, and a decoder
 * that cannot handle the codec renders nothing but does not take the socket down with it.
 *
 * Deliberately a streak rather than a single occurrence. One starved session is ordinary — a phone
 * being unplugged mid-bring-up looks exactly like this once — and advice given on the strength of
 * one is advice that will sometimes be wrong.
 *
 * **This used to only advise**, and telling the user to lower the resolution by hand is what an
 * Android 4.4 tablet needed three failed bring-ups to be told. [shouldCap] is the same streak
 * acting on itself: the profile comes down and the picture arrives.

     * edge, so it holds for as long as the streak does, and the same streak that produced the
     * advice produces the cap.

     * **What retires it is not this function.** The cap is what makes the next session render, and

     * uncap, starve three more times and be earned again forever. The conclusion is kept instead
     * (`Settings.videoProfileStarvationCap`) and only the user changing the resolution or the frame
     * rate takes it back off, which is the same shape as the playback-focus latch.
