/**
 * Whether a wake stood down by [BluetoothWakePolicy.WakeReason.TARGET_CONNECTED] has waited long
 * enough to go out anyway.
 *
 * Android Auto starts wireless setup from a Bluetooth *event*, not from a connected state:
 * `WifiBluetoothReceiver` filters `ACL_CONNECTED` and the HFP and A2DP
 * `CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGED`, and its own tokens are `WIRELESS_SETUP_SHARED_HFP_CONNECTING` and
 * siblings. A radio that auto-connects hands-free and holds it across a session and past its end
 * raises no further event, so the phone never re-triggers and the stand-down is permanent.
 *
 * The poke is what produces that event, at the measured cost of the phone's hands-free slot, so it
 * is budgeted rather than freed: only for a pairing that has already run Android Auto on this unit,
 * only [MAX_ESCALATED_WAKES] times per arming, and only while [NativeAaWakeDamagePolicy] has not
 * measured this unit losing the link for good.
