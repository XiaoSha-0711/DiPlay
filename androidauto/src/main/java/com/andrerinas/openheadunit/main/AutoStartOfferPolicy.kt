 * Whether to offer Bluetooth auto-start for the phone that has connected to this unit.

 * Auto-start used to turn itself on: a completed handshake wrote the peer into the trigger list, so
 * a user who never asked found the app launching itself. Asking once, about the one phone that can
 * be meant, is what replaces that.
 *
 * Pure, so every combination is a unit test rather than a device.
